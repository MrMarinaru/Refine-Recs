# Refine-Recs 🎬🎮

A personalized movie recommender system built using **PyTorch**, aimed at learning user preferences through interactive feedback.

This is a long-term Machine Learning project by **Mrinal**, **Hardik**, and **Divisha**, designed to strengthen hands-on skills in recommendation algorithms and collaborative development. It’s being developed alongside our B.Tech CSE (AI & ML) coursework to apply classroom concepts in a practical, self-driven way.

## 💡 Project Goals
- Create a smart movie recommendation engine using user-selected inputs like genre, actor, and public rating
- Adapt recommendations over time through a feedback loop (approve/reject system)
- Explore foundational ML techniques with PyTorch and Python libraries

## 📈 Current Progress
- 🎯 Dataset preprocessing and filtering logic done
- 🧠 Scoring algorithm under test with dummy data
- 🔄 Feedback system in planning
- 🖼️ Frontend and UI mockup to follow

## 🛠️ Tech Stack
- Python
- PyTorch
- Pandas, NumPy, Matplotlib
- Git & GitHub (first open development effort for the team)
