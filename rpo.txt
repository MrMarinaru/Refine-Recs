Let’s go, Marinaru. Instead of day-wise chunks, here’s a **modular, phase-wise roadmap**. This is how pros plan — focus on *goals and outcomes*, not just deadlines.

---

## 🧩 **PROJECT STRUCTURE: MOVIE/GAME RECOMMENDER SYSTEM (LEARNING-ORIENTED)**

---

### 🔧 **PHASE 0: Setup and Initialization**

**Goals**: Create clean project skeleton + initialize Git + prepare for modular dev.

#### Tasks:

* Install:

  * Python (ensure 3.9+)
  * Git, GitHub Desktop (optional), VS Code
  * `pip install pandas numpy matplotlib requests torch`
* Create folders:

  ```
  project_root/
  ├── data/            ← for datasets
  ├── notebooks/       ← Jupyter experiments
  ├── models/          ← saved PyTorch models
  ├── src/             ← scripts (data, model, logic)
  ├── utils/           ← helper functions
  ├── main.py          ← CLI entry point
  ├── README.md        ← project intro
  └── requirements.txt ← pip freeze > requirements.txt
  ```
* Git init:

  * `git init`, `.gitignore`, `git add .`, `git commit -m "Initial commit"`

> ✅ *At this point, your repo is clean, versioned, and ready to evolve.*

---

### 📥 **PHASE 1: Data Gathering + Preprocessing**

**Goals**: Gather raw data (movies/games) from APIs and format it.

#### Tasks:

* Choose sources:

  * TMDB API (movies)
  * RAWG API (games)
* For each item, pull:

  * Title, genres, actors (or developers), public rating, release date
* Store it in `data/raw_data.csv`
* Preprocess:

  * Clean nulls
  * Standardize genre and actor names
  * Normalize ratings (0–1)

> ✅ You now have a structured dataset of titles ready for encoding.

---

### 🧮 **PHASE 2: Feature Engineering**

**Goals**: Convert raw attributes to numerical vectors for the model.

#### Tasks:

* **One-hot encode**:

  * Genres
  * Actors (pick top N actors to avoid sparse matrix)
* Normalize numeric fields like public score
* Create user input simulation:

  * Let the user "select" genre, score threshold, and liked/disliked actors
* Build a user preference vector

> ✅ You have a clean feature matrix for both titles and simulated user input.

---

### 🧠 **PHASE 3: PyTorch Model Building**

**Goals**: Learn PyTorch while building a working model.

#### Tasks:

* Define a simple `torch.nn.Module`:

  * Input: concatenated title + user vectors
  * Hidden: 2–3 layers
  * Output: 1 neuron → sigmoid → approval probability
* Use:

  * `BCELoss` or `BCEWithLogitsLoss`
  * `Adam` optimizer
* Train with simulated feedback data (`X`, `y`)

> ✅ You now have a model that can take a user profile + title and predict the match score.

---

### 🔁 **PHASE 4: Feedback Integration**

**Goals**: Build the loop that trains the model with user feedback.

#### Tasks:

* Simulate feedback (approve/reject a recommendation)
* Store every interaction as `(features, label)`
* Train the model incrementally:

  * Add new data to the training set
  * Re-train or fine-tune the model
* Optional:

  * Track user "profile drift" — tastes changing over time

> ✅ System now *learns and adapts* based on real usage.

---

### 🔍 **PHASE 5: Evaluation & Improvements**

**Goals**: Understand how well your system performs and iterate.

#### Tasks:

* Track:

  * Accuracy
  * Precision/Recall (optional)
  * Loss curve per epoch
* Try:

  * Changing hidden layers
  * Adjusting learning rate
  * Filtering based on genre alone to compare baseline

> ✅ You now understand how to improve models through evaluation and experimentation.

---

### 💻 **PHASE 6: Final Output Interface**

**Goals**: Make your project testable and presentable.

#### Options:

* CLI-based test (`main.py`):

  * Ask for user prefs
  * Recommend top 5 titles
  * Let user type 'approve/reject'
* Or simple **Streamlit** UI (1-page web app)
* Save:

  * Model in `/models/`
  * Logs of interactions
  * Update `README.md` with example usage

> ✅ Now it’s a real product demo — perfect for your GitHub profile.

---

### 🌐 **PHASE 7: GitHub Finalization**

**Goals**: Polish and share the project properly.

#### Tasks:

* Push regularly to GitHub using:

  * `git status`, `git add .`, `git commit -m "..."`, `git push`
* Create:

  * `README.md` with badges, usage, screenshots
  * `requirements.txt`
* Optional:

  * Add `LICENSE`
  * Tag release versions (`git tag v1.0`)

---

## 🧠 Skills You'll Learn:

* Python API wrangling
* Data preprocessing
* Feature encoding
* PyTorch architecture design
* Feedback loop learning
* Git & GitHub workflows
* CLI/Streamlit app building

Whenever you say the word, we can start **PHASE 0**, and I’ll walk you through every single line with clear explanations, hands-on code, and logic breakdowns. Ready when you are, Marinaru ⚔️
